The scallops entree I had and the Rib Eye my husband had were perfectly prepared. The drinks were good but we only wanted one each and had to reiterate that a couple of times with different servers, (felt like a little bit of sales pressure on the drinks throughout our meal). \nThe homemade donuts with creme brulee filling are amazing! \nLove ambience of this restaurant as it's light and airy and has a lot of very comfortable seating."}

At least Goodwill is honest in its' marketing pitch. There, I have actually found clothing items that were high end at mere fraction of the cost."}

When I got home to eat a few minutes later, I was pretty disappointed. The fries were hot, but had no salt on them. There was also no ketchup or salt packets in the bad, so the fries were not that good. The burger was equally bland. There was no seasoning on it and I can tell that the burger was not fresh. It was cold and seems like it was grilled hours before. \n\nFrozen burgers, frozen fries, no flavor. \n\nSad, I was expecting more."}

Tasted like just ground pork. No spice and no heat. I took the casings off the remainder sausages and put the meat in a bowl and added all the spices and crushed chili and also paprika for added heat. It's too bad. \nI won't be buying their Italian sausages again."}

Nolan (Manager) was very professional, courteous and actually listened to what I had to say. His other employees were awesome as well and I will return to their business. After a bad experience with Jiffy Lube in the past, I am happy to have found a great place for oil changes (and other services). Thanks ALL at Valvoline."}
